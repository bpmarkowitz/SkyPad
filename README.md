- Follow Steps [outlined here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device)

## What won't this app do?
- Provide anything near a native expereince
- Send alerts and notifications
- No dark mode support (yet)

## What will it to?
- Let you run the Bluesky web app full screen, split view, and slide over

- Swipe to go back (New!)
- Opens external links directly in the system browser
